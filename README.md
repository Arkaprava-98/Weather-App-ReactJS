Hello Folks,

I am Arkaprava Chakrabarty. An aspirant web Developer.

This is a Simple Weather Application Website build with ReactJS framework. 

Also with two API :
    1. Open Weather Map API ==> "https://openweathermap.org/" 
    2. GeoDB Cities API ==> "https://rapidapi.com/wirefreethought/api/geodb-cities/"

As the API keys are personal, I have provided the links used in the project. Just Sign in and Subscribe to the API and you are all set to go.

Host the website with firebase as I did.
Why? Because its simple and capable to handle the site

You can download the Project icon file from the above public folder.
